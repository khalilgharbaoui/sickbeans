# ðŸ¤® SICKBEANS

Functionality: 

- This web app ingests CSV data via a seed file to display 307 soybeans
- Soybeans containing selected diseases, injuries, and traits are removed from sample
- Soybean data structure stored in hash table in Bean model to create seed data 
- Soybean data collection stored in Bean model to create view form labels
- Search params transformed into hash table via Bean model 
- Soybean data is displayed on rollover
- Form doesn't reload the page thanks to AJAX
- Javascript clears search parameters

Features I'd like to add in the future: 

- Mobile responsiveness
- Ensure popups never appear off screen 
- Further refactor Bean model code
- Loader animation
